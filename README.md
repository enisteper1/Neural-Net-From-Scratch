 Purpose of this project is to understand how deep learning models are trained. One of the most used machine learning algorithms are deep learning algorithms. However, libraries like tensorflow, pytorch and sklearn(mlp) able us able to build neural networks at ease which prevents understanding of how weights are optimized. For this reason we will define our neural network and add attributes for train and test it. The data set that will be used is wisconsin data set that I analyzed, visualized and trained at [Wisconsin-Breast-Cancer-EDA ](https://github.com/enisteper1/Wisconsin-Breast-Cancer-EDA).
